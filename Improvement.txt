Room for improvement in the programs

String can be converted to charArray for memory efficiency
i.e. char chararray[] = string.toCharArray();

StringBuilder should be used instead of String for faster programs

string + "hello"   internally uses StringBuilder, no need of micro-optimization

Call System.gc() whenever you feel that some memory has been leaked 

we should use array.length as it is an O(1) operation
